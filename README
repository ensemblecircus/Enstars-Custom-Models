Enstars Custom Models Pack

# Resources #
## Blockbench: ## 
I made use of InTheLittleWood's custom hats and items tutorial.
    link: https://youtu.be/Cw8PPPEl_IQ?si=hfROSz7kzTfO0ZPc
His tutorial is very helpful, aside from 2 points: 
### 1 ###
    The code for his carved_pumpkin.json causes the original carved pumpkin
    item texture to not appear. The code in the file should be:

    {
    "parent": "minecraft:block/carved_pumpkin",

    "overrides": [
    {"predicate": {"custom_model_data":1}, "model": "block/custom/tutorial"}
    ]
    }
        As a side note, JSON files do not allow for commenting, which I learned
        in the process of creating this pack.
    This solution was provided by reddit user dragonmaster95 under this post:

### 2 ###
    His method of adding custom items requires commands to acquire them.

## Minecraft ##
The implementation of custom models is possible primarily through the use of
the Minecraft feature, custom model data. The tutorial I looked at as a
supplement to InTheLittleWood's tutorial was by Simplexity-Development on
GitHub.

## Minecraft Assets ## 
I had to look at a few minecraft assets in order to debug some issues, and 
mcasset.cloud was extremely helpful to me.

## Optifine: ##
I am using Optifine for 1.20.4, and its Custom Item Textures (CIT) feature.
    Optifine is required for this pack to be used. 
I made use of the short guide to using Optifine's CIT feature under this reddit
post:
